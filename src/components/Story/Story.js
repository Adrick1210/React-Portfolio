          With compassion and passion for problem solving, I have dove into the
          world of web development and software engineering. My background in
          automotive maintenance and repair has instilled in me the virtues of
          patience and precision, enabling me to approach both minor and complex
          problems with clarity and determination. Using the technical and
          physical skills I've honed in the automotive field, I currently
          transition into my work in software development, where I thrive to
          tackle new challenges.
